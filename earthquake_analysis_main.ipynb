    "## 3.0 Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "Reliable analysis begins with a dataset that is complete, consistent and physically meaningful. Earthquake data is particularly sensitive to measurement quality. Small errors in magnitude, depth, time or location can distort global patterns and weaken any statistical conclusions. For this reason, a structured and domain-appropriate cleaning pipeline was applied to the 2023 global earthquake dataset to ensure that every event used in this project is valid, accurate and suitable for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset provided by the USGS is generally well structured, but still contains a number of issues that must be addressed before performing meaningful analysis. These include occasional fully duplicated rows, multiple versions of the same earthquake (with earlier records containing outdated measurements), a small number of values that fall outside physically realistic ranges and non earthquieke type explotions. The aim of the cleaning process is not to remove large portions of the data or introduce unnecessary filtering, but simply to correct errors and ensure that each earthquake record is scientifically reasonable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cleaning pipeline used in this project consists of the following key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Work on a copy of the data**  \n",
    "A fresh copy of the dataset is created to protect the original raw data. This avoids accidental modifications and preserves the integrity of the input file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Remove exact duplicate records**  \n",
    "Fully duplicated rows occasionally appear in exported or merged datasets. These provide no new information and would artificially inflate earthquake counts if left in place. All exact duplicates were removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Remove duplicate earthquake identifiers, keeping only the most recent update**  \n",
    "The `id` field uniquely identifies each earthquake. In some cases, the same event appears more than once because the USGS updates its magnitude, depth or location as new sensor data arrives. The dataset was sorted by the `updated` timestamp, ensuring that only the most recent and most accurate version of each event is retained.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that repeated `id` values do not represent different “stages” of an earthquake. Earthquakes do not physically change in magnitude or depth over time. Multiple entries simply reflect measurement corrections by the seismic network. Therefore, retaining only the latest updated version ensures analytical accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Convert time fields into proper datetime format**  \n",
    "The `time` and `updated` columns were converted from text into real datetime objects. This step is required for all time-based analysis such as monthly grouping, temporal visualisation and event ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Ensure core numeric fields are numeric and remove missing essential values**\n",
    "The core physical attributes of each earthquake latitude, longitude, depth and magnitude must be stored as numbers.These columns were converted to numeric values using errors=\"coerce\", which safely transforms invalid entries (e.g., text or corrupted values) into NaN. Rows missing any of these essential fields were removed, as they cannot be displayed on maps or used in magnitude/depth analysis. The 2023 dataset is generally complete, so this step removed only a very small number of invalid rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Remove rows missing essential physical attributes**  \n",
    "Every earthquake must have a valid `time`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `depth` and `mag`. \n",
    "Without these, the event cannot be plotted, positioned geographically, or included in magnitude or depth analysis. Any rows missing these core fields were removed. The 2023 dataset is highly complete, so no events were lost at this stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Apply geophysical validity checks**  \n",
    "Basic physical constraints were enforced to ensure that all retained records represent real, possible earthquakes. These checks include:\n",
    "- Latitude within −90 to 90 degrees  \n",
    "- Longitude within −180 to 180 degrees  \n",
    "- The deepest earthquake in the dataset occurred at 681 km, which is within the scientifically known maximum depth for natural earthquakes (∼700 km). For this reason, depth values were restricted to the range 0–700 km to remove impossible values while keeping all real deep-focus events\n",
    "- Magnitude within the realistic range of 0 to 10\n",
    "Any record falling outside these limits was removed, as such values reflect data errors rather than genuine seismic activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Keep only real earthquakes (remove explosions and other event types)**\n",
    "The dataset includes different types of seismic events, such as quarry blasts, mining explosions, ice quakes and testing activity.These are not natural earthquakes and would distort global patterns.Only rows where type == \"earthquake\" were retained.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-essential fields such as `gap`, `dmin`, `nst`, `horizontalError`, `magError` and \n",
    "`place` contain some missing values, but these do not prevent spatial or statistical analysis. Removing rows based on these optional metadata fields would unnecessarily reduce the dataset and bias the analysis toward only well-recorded earthquakes\n",
    "These fields were therefore kept as they are."

The epicentre map from Section 3 showed events clustered along major tectonic plate boundaries, indicating the cleaning pipeline removed spurious measurements.\n",

    "- Magnitude is continuous; communication uses descriptors (moderate, strong, major).\n",
    "- Latitude/longitude are exact but don’t directly compare regions (e.g., Americas vs Asia–Pacific).\n",

    "1) Domain interpretability — features reflect seismology concepts (depth classes, magnitude labels, tectonic regions).  \n",
    "2) Reproducibility/modularity — one function regenerates the full feature set consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.1.1 Temporal Features — When Earthquakes Occur\n",
    "- `year`, `month`, `month_name`\n",
    "- `day`, `day_of_week`, `day_name`\n",
    "- `hour`, `part_of_day` (night/morning/afternoon/evening)\n",
    "- `is_weekend`\n",
    "- `season`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.1.2 Physical Severity Features — How Strong or Deep\n",
    "- `depth_category`: shallow (0–70 km), intermediate (70–300 km), deep (300–700 km)\n",
    "- `mag_category`: minor, light, moderate, strong, major, great, massive\n",
    "- `is_strong_quake`: mag ≥ 6.0\n",
    "- `energy_log10_J`: log energy proxy (Gutenberg–Richter)\n",
    "\n",
    "Depth bins follow the standard shallow/intermediate/deep convention. Magnitude bins mirror common communication labels. Small shifts to edges don’t materially change patterns; adjust if a modelling task needs different cut points.\n",

    "#### 4.1.3 Geographical Context Features — Where Earthquakes Occur\n",
    "- `abs_latitude`, `abs_longitude`\n",
    "- `distance_from_equator_km`, `distance_from_prime_meridian_km`\n",
    "- `hemisphere_NS`, `hemisphere_EW`\n",
    "- `broad_region`: Americas, Europe–Africa, Asia–Pacific, Oceania\n",
    "\n",
    "`broad_region` is a coarse tectonic grouping to reveal global patterns; a finer distance-to-plate-boundary feature is a natural future enhancement when plate geometries are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.1.4 Data-Quality Features — How Reliable the Measurements Are\n",
    "- Boolean indicators (e.g., `has_depthError`)\n",
    "- Min–max normalization of uncertainties\n",
    "- Composite `quality_score` (1 = highest quality)\n",
    "\n",
    "`quality_score` is an unweighted mean of normalized uncertainties; if some uncertainties matter more, use a weighted average or PCA-based composite as a refinement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.1.5 Categorical Encodings\n",
    "- Convenience ordinal codes `*_code` for categorical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical codes (`*_code`) are convenience ordinals; for ML, one-hot or embed them, and scale continuous features before most models.\n"

    "## Interpretation of Global Earthquake Epicentres\n",
    "\n",
    "The enhanced global epicentre map presents a geophysically coherent distribution of earthquake activity, with events aligning precisely along the major tectonic plate interfaces. The strongest and most persistent seismic zones—such as the **Pacific Ring of Fire**, the **Japan–Kurile arc**, the **Tonga–Kermadec subduction system**, the **Indonesian convergence zone**, and the **Peru–Chile trench**—appear as continuous, high-density belts of epicentres. These alignments coincide exactly with expected plate boundaries, confirming both the geographical accuracy of the cleaned dataset and the correctness of the engineered spatial variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The visual encoding integrates two fundamental physical dimensions of earthquakes:  \n",
    "- **magnitude**, represented by a perceptually uniform colour scale, and  \n",
    "- **focal depth**, expressed through marker size.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This dual encoding reveals important physical structure. **Shallow earthquakes** (0–70 km), shown as larger markers, dominate global seismicity and cluster densely along subduction interfaces, where interplate friction generates frequent, high-magnitude thrust events. **Intermediate-depth earthquakes** (70–300 km) trace well-defined Wadati–Benioff zones beneath Japan, Tonga, Indonesia and the Andean margin, illustrating the geometry of subducting slabs. **Deep-focus earthquakes** (300–700 km), while comparatively rare, appear exclusively within these subduction corridors—consistent with established geodynamic models of cold, sinking lithosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inclusion of annotated hotspots (Japan, Chile, Turkey, Tonga, California) further emphasises regions of chronic stress accumulation and complex fault interaction. Complementary regional labels—such as the **Mediterranean Belt**, **Himalayas**, **Cascadia**, and the **East African Rift**—demonstrate that the engineered geographic variables (e.g. `broad_region`, `hemisphere_NS`, `distance_from_equator_km`) correctly segment the dataset into meaningful tectonic provinces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the figure provides strong validation of the feature-engineering pipeline. The enriched dataset preserves the expected structural patterns of global seismicity, while the engineered attributes (depth categories, magnitude classes, distance measures, and region codes) make previously implicit geophysical relationships more observable. The map therefore functions as both a diagnostic check of dataset integrity and a substantive foundation for the exploratory and modelling work presented in subsequent sections.\n"

    "### 4.6 Summary and Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature-engineering stage transformed the cleaned earthquake catalogue into a structured, analysis-ready dataset that captures the multi-dimensional nature of global seismicity. The `engineer_features()` function integrates temporal descriptors (e.g. month, season, diurnal cycle), physical severity indicators (magnitude class, depth category, energy proxy), spatial context (hemispheres, distance measures, broad tectonic regions), and data-quality metrics (normalised uncertainty measures and composite quality scores). Importantly, these transformations preserve the original event count and maintain full traceability back to the raw USGS observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagnostic visualisations confirm that the engineered features behave in a geophysically meaningful way. Temporal variables reveal realistic seasonal and monthly variations in global seismic reporting. Depth and magnitude classes highlight the dominance of shallow crustal earthquakes and the physical structure of subduction-driven Wadati–Benioff zones. Spatial features correctly reproduce the clustering of epicentres along the major tectonic boundaries, while quality-score distributions expose variation in observational precision across different regions and magnitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "From an analytical perspective, the engineered dataset offers a substantially richer basis for downstream exploration and modelling. The introduction of interpretable categories improves descriptive analysis, while the numeric encodings (e.g. `*_code`) provide a machine-learning–friendly representation. For any predictive modelling task, categorical features should be one-hot encoded or embedded, and continuous features should be appropriately scaled to ensure numerical stability and fair weighting across dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key strength of the approach is its reproducibility: because `engineer_features()` is implemented as a modular function, it can be applied to future USGS catalogues with no manual intervention. This guarantees that new datasets will inherit the same engineered structure, ensuring consistent analysis pipelines over time. Overall, the feature-engineering process successfully bridges raw seismic measurements and structured analytical insight, forming the foundation for the exploratory analysis and modelling undertaken in the subsequent sections.\n"

    "### 9. Modelling\n",
    "This section outlines how to operationalise the engineered catalogue into a classifier for strong events and an optional ordinal model for magnitude buckets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9.1 Problem Definition\n",
    "- Primary objective: flag strong earthquakes (mag >= 6.0) quickly; optimise for recall/precision on the positive class because the catalog is imbalanced.\n",
    "- Secondary objective: predict `mag_category` as an ordinal multi-class task to prioritise response tiers.\n",
    "- Split train/validation/test chronologically (e.g., 70/15/15) and stratify by `broad_region` to limit spatial leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9.2 Feature Selection & Preprocessing\n",
    "- Candidate predictors: depth, latitude/longitude, `gap`, `rms`, `depthError`, `magError`, `horizontalError`, `quality_score`, `depth_category_code`, `broad_region_code`, hemisphere codes, `part_of_day`, `season`, and distance-from-equator/prime-meridian features. Exclude raw `mag`/`mag_category` when they define the target.\n",
    "- Handle class imbalance with class weights and/or sample weights proportional to `quality_score`; optionally drop events below a `quality_score` threshold.\n",
    "- Pipeline: `ColumnTransformer` with `StandardScaler` for numeric features and `OneHotEncoder` for categoricals; impute numeric medians and most-frequent categories. Package the whole pipeline so preprocessing and model stay coupled.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9.3 Model Training\n",
    "- Baselines: `LogisticRegression` (balanced class weights) plus tree ensembles (RandomForest/GradientBoosting) for non-linear interactions; optionally wrap in `CalibratedClassifierCV` for probability quality.\n",
    "- Cross-validate (e.g., StratifiedKFold=5) with F1 and PR-AUC for the strong class; tune decision thresholds on the validation split to balance missed alerts vs false alarms.\n",
    "- Persist the fitted pipeline with joblib and record metadata (training window, feature list, metrics) in a small JSON manifest.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9.4 Model Evaluation & Interpretation\n",
    "- Report confusion matrix, precision/recall/F1, ROC-AUC, and PR-AUC on the hold-out set; slice metrics by `broad_region` and `depth_category` to test generalisation.\n",
    "- Use permutation importance or SHAP (if available) to confirm drivers (depth, region, uncertainty terms); plot partial dependence for depth and `quality_score`.\n",
    "- Plot calibration curves and reliability diagrams; monitor drift by re-scoring monthly batches as new catalogue data lands.\n"

    "### 10. Discussion & Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10.1 Key Findings\n",
    "- Global epicentres cluster along subduction belts (notably the Pacific rim), with shallow crustal events dominating counts while intermediate/deep slices still host notable strong events.\n",
    "- Magnitude vs depth shows modest correlation; high-magnitude events are not confined to the deepest bins, reinforcing the need to model across depth classes.\n",
    "- Quality-score analysis indicates most events are measured with high fidelity, but a thin low-quality tail (high `magError`/`gap`) should be down-weighted or reviewed before modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10.2 Strengths of the Analytical Pipeline\n",
    "- Reusable cleaning and feature-engineering functions shared between the notebook and export scripts keep results reproducible.\n",
    "- Interactive spatial visualisations paired with summary tables make regional patterns and uncertainty interpretable for non-technical readers.\n",
    "- Uncertainty-aware metrics (quality-score slicing, error columns) are surfaced before any predictive step.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10.3 Limitations\n",
    "- Catalogue completeness varies by region/time; smaller events are under-reported, biasing magnitude and depth distributions.\n",
    "- `broad_region` is longitude-based and coarse; no focal mechanisms or tectonic setting variables are included yet.\n",
    "- Modelling remains a blueprint in this notebook; performance claims await an implemented training run.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10.4 Future Work\n",
    "- Train and validate the outlined classifier/regressor with temporal cross-validation and calibrated probabilities.\n",
    "- Enrich geography with plate-boundary shapefiles and proximity features; add geodetic/elevation context where available.\n",
    "- Automate monthly refreshes (data pull, cleaning, plots, model scoring) to keep the dashboard current.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10.5 Conclusion\n",
    "The EDA establishes data health, spatial clustering, and uncertainty structure. Next steps are to deploy an uncertainty-aware classifier, monitor it over time, and keep incorporating new catalogue data to refine both the map and the model.\n"
